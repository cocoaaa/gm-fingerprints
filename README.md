# GM Fingerprints

This is a source repo for our  homepage for our project on studying the fingerprints of generative models.
- Visit our [demo site](https://cocoaaa.github.io/gm-fpts-page/) for testing artifacts and fingerprints of various geneartive models (including Stable Diffusion, Latent Diffusion Models, StyleGANs) left on their genearted images 

## Updates
- **March, 2024**: We will soon release our GM dataset consisting of 14+ state-of-the-art (vision) generative models as well as the code for our paper.
- **Feb, 2024**:  Our paper ([arxiv:2402.10401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10401)) is accepted to CVPR24!
